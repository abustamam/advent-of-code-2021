    "first": "\\--- Day 3: Binary Diagnostic ---\n----------\n\nThe submarine has been making some odd creaking noises, so you ask it to produce a diagnostic report just in case.\n\nThe diagnostic report (your puzzle input) consists of a list of binary numbers which, when decoded properly, can tell you many useful things about the conditions of the submarine. The first parameter to check is the *power consumption*.\n\nYou need to use the binary numbers in the diagnostic report to generate two new binary numbers (called the *gamma rate* and the *epsilon rate*). The power consumption can then be found by multiplying the gamma rate by the epsilon rate.\n\nEach bit in the gamma rate can be determined by finding the *most common bit in the corresponding position* of all numbers in the diagnostic report. For example, given the following diagnostic report:\n\n```\n00100\n11110\n10110\n10111\n10101\n01111\n00111\n11100\n10000\n11001\n00010\n01010\n\n```\n\nConsidering only the first bit of each number, there are five `0` bits and seven `1` bits. Since the most common bit is `1`, the first bit of the gamma rate is `1`.\n\nThe most common second bit of the numbers in the diagnostic report is `0`, so the second bit of the gamma rate is `0`.\n\nThe most common value of the third, fourth, and fifth bits are `1`, `1`, and `0`, respectively, and so the final three bits of the gamma rate are `110`.\n\nSo, the gamma rate is the binary number `10110`, or `*22*` in decimal.\n\nThe epsilon rate is calculated in a similar way; rather than use the most common bit, the least common bit from each position is used. So, the epsilon rate is `01001`, or `*9*` in decimal. Multiplying the gamma rate (`22`) by the epsilon rate (`9`) produces the power consumption, `*198*`.\n\nUse the binary numbers in your diagnostic report to calculate the gamma rate and epsilon rate, then multiply them together. *What is the power consumption of the submarine?* (Be sure to represent your answer in decimal, not binary.)\n\nYour puzzle answer was `2003336`.\n\nThe first half of this puzzle is complete! It provides one gold star: \\*\n\n\\--- Part Two ---\n----------\n\nNext, you should verify the *life support rating*, which can be determined by multiplying the *oxygen generator rating* by the *CO2 scrubber rating*.\n\nBoth the oxygen generator rating and the CO2 scrubber rating are values that can be found in your diagnostic report - finding them is the tricky part. Both values are located using a similar process that involves filtering out values until only one remains. Before searching for either rating value, start with the full list of binary numbers from your diagnostic report and *consider just the first bit* of those numbers. Then:\n\n* Keep only numbers selected by the *bit criteria* for the type of rating value for which you are searching. Discard numbers which do not match the bit criteria.\n* If you only have one number left, stop; this is the rating value for which you are searching.\n* Otherwise, repeat the process, considering the next bit to the right.\n\nThe *bit criteria* depends on which type of rating value you want to find:\n\n* To find *oxygen generator rating*, determine the *most common* value (`0` or `1`) in the current bit position, and keep only numbers with that bit in that position. If `0` and `1` are equally common, keep values with a `*1*` in the position being considered.\n* To find *CO2 scrubber rating*, determine the *least common* value (`0` or `1`) in the current bit position, and keep only numbers with that bit in that position. If `0` and `1` are equally common, keep values with a `*0*` in the position being considered.\n\nFor example, to determine the *oxygen generator rating* value using the same example diagnostic report from above:\n\n* Start with all 12 numbers and consider only the first bit of each number. There are more `1` bits (7) than `0` bits (5), so keep only the 7 numbers with a `1` in the first position: `11110`, `10110`, `10111`, `10101`, `11100`, `10000`, and `11001`.\n* Then, consider the second bit of the 7 remaining numbers: there are more `0` bits (4) than `1` bits (3), so keep only the 4 numbers with a `0` in the second position: `10110`, `10111`, `10101`, and `10000`.\n* In the third position, three of the four numbers have a `1`, so keep those three: `10110`, `10111`, and `10101`.\n* In the fourth position, two of the three numbers have a `1`, so keep those two: `10110` and `10111`.\n* In the fifth position, there are an equal number of `0` bits and `1` bits (one each). So, to find the *oxygen generator rating*, keep the number with a `1` in that position: `10111`.\n* As there is only one number left, stop; the *oxygen generator rating* is `10111`, or `*23*` in decimal.\n\nThen, to determine the *CO2 scrubber rating* value from the same example above:\n\n* Start again with all 12 numbers and consider only the first bit of each number. There are fewer `0` bits (5) than `1` bits (7), so keep only the 5 numbers with a `0` in the first position: `00100`, `01111`, `00111`, `00010`, and `01010`.\n* Then, consider the second bit of the 5 remaining numbers: there are fewer `1` bits (2) than `0` bits (3), so keep only the 2 numbers with a `1` in the second position: `01111` and `01010`.\n* In the third position, there are an equal number of `0` bits and `1` bits (one each). So, to find the *CO2 scrubber rating*, keep the number with a `0` in that position: `01010`.\n* As there is only one number left, stop; the *CO2 scrubber rating* is `01010`, or `*10*` in decimal.\n\nFinally, to find the life support rating, multiply the oxygen generator rating (`23`) by the CO2 scrubber rating (`10`) to get `*230*`.\n\nUse the binary numbers in your diagnostic report to calculate the oxygen generator rating and CO2 scrubber rating, then multiply them together. *What is the life support rating of the submarine?* (Be sure to represent your answer in decimal, not binary.)\n\nAnswer:\n\nAlthough it hasn't changed, you can still [get your puzzle input](3/input).",
