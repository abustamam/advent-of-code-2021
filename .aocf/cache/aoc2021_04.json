What you *can* see, however, is a giant squid that has attached itself to the outside of your submarine.\n\nMaybe it wants to play [bingo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bingo_(American_version))?\n\nBingo is played on a set of boards each consisting of a 5x5 grid of numbers. Numbers are chosen at random, and the chosen number is *marked* on all boards on which it appears. (Numbers may not appear on all boards.) If all numbers in any row or any column of a board are marked, that board *wins*. (Diagonals don't count.)\n\nThe submarine has a *bingo subsystem* to help passengers (currently, you and the giant squid) pass the time. It automatically generates a random order in which to draw numbers and a random set of boards (your puzzle input). For example:\n\n```\n7,4,9,5,11,17,23,2,0,14,21,24,10,16,13,6,15,25,12,22,18,20,8,19,3,26,1\n\n22 13 17 11  0\n 8  2 23  4 24\n21  9 14 16  7\n 6 10  3 18  5\n 1 12 20 15 19\n\n 3 15  0  2 22\n 9 18 13 17  5\n19  8  7 25 23\n20 11 10 24  4\n14 21 16 12  6\n\n14 21 17 24  4\n10 16 15  9 19\n18  8 23 26 20\n22 11 13  6  5\n 2  0 12  3  7\n\n```\n\nAfter the first five numbers are drawn (`7`, `4`, `9`, `5`, and `11`), there are no winners, but the boards are marked as follows (shown here adjacent to each other to save space):\n\n```\n22 13 17 11  0         3 15  0  2 22        14 21 17 24  4\n 8  2 23  4 24         9 18 13 17  5        10 16 15  9 19\n21  9 14 16  7        19  8  7 25 23        18  8 23 26 20\n 6 10  3 18  5        20 11 10 24  4        22 11 13  6  5\n 1 12 20 15 19        14 21 16 12  6         2  0 12  3  7\n\n```\n\nAfter the next six numbers are drawn (`17`, `23`, `2`, `0`, `14`, and `21`), there are still no winners:\n\n```\n22 13 17 11  0         3 15  0  2 22        14 21 17 24  4\n 8  2 23  4 24         9 18 13 17  5        10 16 15  9 19\n21  9 14 16  7        19  8  7 25 23        18  8 23 26 20\n 6 10  3 18  5        20 11 10 24  4        22 11 13  6  5\n 1 12 20 15 19        14 21 16 12  6         2  0 12  3  7\n\n```\n\nFinally, `24` is drawn:\n\n```\n22 13 17 11  0         3 15  0  2 22        14 21 17 24  4\n 8  2 23  4 24         9 18 13 17  5        10 16 15  9 19\n21  9 14 16  7        19  8  7 25 23        18  8 23 26 20\n 6 10  3 18  5        20 11 10 24  4        22 11 13  6  5\n 1 12 20 15 19        14 21 16 12  6         2  0 12  3  7\n\n```\n\nAt this point, the third board *wins* because it has at least one complete row or column of marked numbers (in this case, the entire top row is marked: `*14 21 17 24 4*`).\n\nThe *score* of the winning board can now be calculated. Start by finding the *sum of all unmarked numbers* on that board; in this case, the sum is `188`. Then, multiply that sum by *the number that was just called* when the board won, `24`, to get the final score, `188 * 24 = *4512*`.\n\nTo guarantee victory against the giant squid, figure out which board will win first. *What will your final score be if you choose that board?*\n\nTo begin, [get your puzzle input](4/input).\n\nAnswer:"
